#![doc = include_str!("README.md")]

//! Implementation notes
//!
//! - In a live [`Store`](crate::Store), effects emitted during an action are queued and drained
//!   before processing subsequent external actions. This provides a strong ordering guarantee for
//!   internal effect chains.
//! - In [`TestStore`](crate::TestStore), effects are recorded but not automatically drained; tests
//!   must explicitly `recv(...)` them.
